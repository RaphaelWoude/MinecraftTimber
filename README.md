# Timber
Created by Sympatic. \
A lightweight timber plugin. \
Inspired by the UHC scenario Timber.
 
Mining a tree causes the whole tree to fall down. \
Using an axe causes the tree to fall down faster. \
The better the axe is, the faster the tree falls down.

This plugin has been tested in 1.7.10 and 1.8.8 and works in these versions. \
Other versions might need some tweaking due to deprecations in the bukkit or spigot api.
